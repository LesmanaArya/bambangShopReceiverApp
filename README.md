## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1
1. RwLock will allow our multi threads to read the Vec data structure by synchronizing access to the shared Notification Vec. This will allow multiple thread to read or access the data structure concurrently and help prevents deadlock. Using Mutex however, will restrict the process to single lock and can reduce performance because of the single threading.

2. In default, static variable in Java are mutable which can have some shared state so it can cause some concurrency issues. It also can cause some risk such as data races and undefined behavior in some cases. Rust static variable by default is immutable so it guarantee us to disable it's modification after it was initialized, which can prevent the shared state issues like static variable i Java

#### Reflection Subscriber-2
1. I've only explored some little things outside of tutorial, src/lib.rs was one that i googled recently. From what i understand, lib.rs is for mananging error handling ultilities which is why there was like Error, ErrorResponse, etc. This part was also responsible for handling app configuration like AppConfig which is why we can use like #[getset].

2. By using Observer pattern will makes the Subscriber (in this case the Observer) can interact or receives notification from the Publisher easily because the Publisher interacts with the Oberserver through Implementation or Interface. The Observer only reacts to the event that generated by Publisher and that's it no specific things required. We can add new subscribers or improve the Subscriber Interface and registering them without have to modify the core application. Spawning more than 1 instances of the Main App is also straightforward since each instance can maintain their status independently.

3. Using Postman allows ourselves to automate the process of verifying API endpoints and responses, which will help us during application testing. We can also add some documentation for our API like it's desccription, usage case, etc to help us in our project team work.
